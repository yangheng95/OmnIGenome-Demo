    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the `OmniGenome` model for RNA secondary structure prediction in a zero-shot setting. The secondary structure of RNA is essential for understanding its function and interactions, and using machine learning models like `OmniGenome` allows us to make accurate predictions directly from sequence data.\n",

    "- Load a pre-trained model for RNA secondary structure prediction.\n",
    "- Perform zero-shot prediction on an RNA sequence.\n",
    "- Use a simplified API for folding sequences.\n",
    "- Compare predictions with the popular RNA folding tool `ViennaRNA`."
